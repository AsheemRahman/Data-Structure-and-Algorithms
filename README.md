# Data Structure and Algorithms

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of **Data Structures** and **Algorithms** implemented in JavaScript/TypeScript. The content is organized on a weekly basis to structure learning progressively, covering foundational topics in data structures and algorithms along with problem-solving exercises.


## Folder Structure

### Week 1
- **Array**: Basic operations, traversal, searching, and sorting.
- **Binary Search**: Efficient search technique for sorted arrays.
- **Linear Search**: Simple search algorithm for unsorted arrays.
- **Linkedlist**: Singly, Doubly, and Circular Linked Lists.
- **Problems**: Collection of various coding problems from competitive platforms.
- **Recursion**: Solving problems using recursive techniques.
- **String**: String manipulation, pattern matching, and common algorithms.

### Week 2
- **Hash Table**: Concepts of Hashing and handling collisions.
- **Queue**: FIFO structure, Circular Queue, Priority Queue.
- **Sort**: Various sorting algorithms including Merge Sort, Quick Sort.
- **Stack**: LIFO structure and common operations.

### Week 3
- **Graph**: Graph traversal methods (BFS, DFS) and shortest path algorithms.
- **Heap**: Min-Heap, Max-Heap, and Heap Sort.
- **Tree**: Binary Trees, BSTs, AVL Trees, and tree traversal methods.
- **Trie**: Prefix trees, used for storing strings in an efficient way.
